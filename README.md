## About
Chinook is a music store which has business around the world.

Recently it has decided to hold a Rock concert. They would like to hold it in a city with the most sales on rock music. 

The concert will also be live online. So Chinook wants to advertising this concert in the top 10 countries with a higher sales on rock music. 

To show their appreciation, they would like to give a promotional discount of 50% to the top 10 best customers for the concert ticket. 

Also they are not sure which artist is the best fit, so they wants us to figure it out.

Our task in this project is to query their database to get insights for them.
